# TODO

 [ ] make sure if using only one grammar, its possible to generate a browser bundle that only contains that parser and not all of them. Dependency injection - user should be able to configure somehow which parsears it will use so only those are combined.
 [ ]implement: wat, unicode, 
  * antlr4, unicode, abnf
  * guido
  * objc, javadoc , pascal, modula, clojure
  * plsql, sqlite, mysql, 
  * less, sass  
   * less important: prolog, xml, mathlab, logo, brainfuck, qbasic, basic, b, aspect-j, asm8080
 [ ] in a separate project, use http://viz-js.com/ and -atn .dot files , and show, for each node type, the graph of it. Just upload the svgs somewhere and show them on hover... 
     * also try to join all the graphs in one big navigable . I can't find references, but incestigate ifelement numbers are, and if them make sense.  java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=JavaScript -visitor Lua.g4 -atn
