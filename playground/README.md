## TODO

vector graphics utilities based on paper.js such as 

 * import svg and pass convertALl so all shapes are converted to paths and `simplify` can be used
 http://paperjs.org/reference/textitem/
 * import a svg document, apply optimizarions and export it as SVG / PDF / JSON formats
 * `simplify` optimization which reduces a svg file generated by geometrize (very image tracers more than three sizes. 
 * This optimization is not done by svgo
 * import svg / JSON and output PDF (PDF is write only - cannot be imported)
   * test if pdfs are availabnle im the brwser (down sthink so)
 * apper-js   
 js api and cli for all od thism 

### Nce to have

 * http://paperjs.org/reference/textitem/ - simple API to print text on SVGs and others
 

## extract diffuse shapes from photo by color matching problem


based on these technology  try to solve the problem of extracting a diffuse shape from a photo removing the rest of it
User gives 1 or more colors C1, c2 and for each an optional threshold to match pixels with similar colors. 

Should support both bitmaps and vectors. 

```
interface  ShapeMatch {
  sourceColor: Color
  threshold: number
  resultColor: Color
}
interface extractShapesByColorOptions {
  shapes: ShapeMatch[]
  /** what to do with the rest (non matching regions */)
  rest?: 'dnothing'|'transparent'|'color'
}
interface extractShapesByColorOptions {
  resultImage: Buffer|string
  shapes: Area[]
  rest: Area
}
extractShapesByColor(options:Options): extractShapesByColorOptionsResult
```


The progrma should: 
identify pixels matching each given color (in the threshold)
