[Playground](https://cancerberosgx.github.io/demos/univac/playground/) (WIP)

See project home page: [Univac AST generator for common programming languages](../)

## TODO

- [ ] replace types with new lines - see bash example breaks dot graphs
- [ ] breadcrumb shows a different hierarchy than ast
- [ ] add the zoom in effect and marquee select tool from https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-view-utilities to tree view. Select several nodes should select several fragments of the editor.
- [ ] alternative tree render mode that groups parent-children using parent graph prop.
- [ ] create a "ast" menu with options: ast graph or default view, show text, auto update, collapse, show minimap, verflow scroll or not. 
- [x] crate a new model for each file and set the language so we have syntax highlight.s
